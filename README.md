# Chess Scoreboard
ChessScoreboard is a project used for maintaining a rating system for chess games using a Google Sheet as the backend data source. This repository contains the web interface for interacting with the scoreboard. There is also a console application that can be found at the [WretchedDade/Chess-Scoreboard-Console](https://github.com/WretchedDade/Chess-Scoreboard-Console) repository. 

# Chess Scoreboard Web Interface
To run the ChessScoreboard Web Interface there are a couple of things you need to do:
* Download node from the [Node.Js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page. It is used to run a local server to allow the application to make calls to the Google Sheets API.
* Next, download the latest version of the master branch and run the 'Start ChessScoreboard.Web.bat' located at the root level.
