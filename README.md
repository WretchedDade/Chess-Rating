# Chess Scoreboard
ChessScoreboard is a project used for maintaining a rating system for chess games using a Google Sheet as the backend data source.

# Chess Scoreboard.Web
To run the ChessScoreboard Web Interface there are a couple of things you need to do:
* Download node from the [Node.Js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page. It is used to run a local server to allow the application to make calls to the Google Sheets API.
* Next, download the latest version of the master branch and run the 'Start ChessScoreboard.Web.bat' located at the root level.
